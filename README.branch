h1. Branch: Unify Publisher and Consumer Configurations

Create a broker registry.

Brokers can be registered with roles.

Brokers are defined as a host:port, vhost, user/pass (rabbit) and other low
level connection parameters.

Publishers are a set of brokers (based on a role), publishing configuration
(message properties, immediate/mandatory flats, retries), marshallers (routing
key fn, message body serializer fn), and AMQP topology (exchange, queues and
bindings).
