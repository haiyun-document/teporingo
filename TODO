Message De-duplication:
  - De-dupe should be opt-in: if you're only using 1 broker, there is no point
  - prototype redis connections: use jedis
  - publish to gen UUID and wrap message body
  - consumers strip additional envelope, call into redis to lock UUID

De-dupe Key Store / Lock Manager
  - in order to not have unbounded growth in the # of keys
    redis must store, implement an expiration policy
  - key expiration policy based on age K[a]
  - purge keys
  - consumers route to dead letter queue / table if/when message being processed has
    an age of M[a] >= 0.9 * K[a]

Publishing:
  - do not use a constant ordering for the brokers to publish to.
    Eg, for [1,2,3] where publishing to 2 of, use different permutations [1,2] [2,3], [3,2], [2,1], ...
    This will help with message ordering (when there are 2 brokers) and spread when there are >2 brokers
  - support N/M publishing constraints: eg: "at least 2(N) of 5(M) brokers"
  - support 2 types of publish calls: 1 that uses redundancy (slower) and one that doesn't
    for the non-redundant, it can be faster and doesn't need to consult the lock manager
  - move 250ms publisher retry delay into configuration
  - do same for other delays, defaults and all other parameters - put into 1 var that can be overridden

Configuration:
- allow teporingo (Clojure rabbit client) publisher configuration to be pulled from config/teporingo.yml
