Message De-duplication:
  - prototype redis connections: use jedis
  - publish to gen UUID and wrap message body
  - consumers strip additional envelope, call into redis to lock UUID

De-dupe Key Store / Lock Manager
  - in order to not have unbounded growth in the # of keys
    redis must store, implement an expiration policy
  - key expiration policy based on age K[a]
  - purge keys
  - consumers route to dead letter queue / table if/when message being processed has
    an age of M[a] >= 0.9 * K[a]
    


Configuration:
- allow teporingo (Clojure rabbit client) publisher configuration to be pulled from config/teporingo.yml
