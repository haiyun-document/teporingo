h1. Features

Default configuration is for exchagnes, queues and bindings to be durable.

h3. Publishing

Publishers are a list of broker configurations.  Publishers are registered to logical names.  Publishing is performed to all the brokers in the configuration.  At least 1 broker must be publised to or the client library throws an exception.

h3. Consuming

Consumers are registered as a logical name.  A consumer is an amqp endpoint configuration (vhost, exchagne, queue, bindings).  Consumers can be started / stopped by requesting to 'add-consumer' of a given registered name.

Consumers will automatically attempt to reconnect if they are shut down unexpectedly.  This will occurr (default is 250ms) until a conneciton can be re-established or until they are explicitly shut down.
